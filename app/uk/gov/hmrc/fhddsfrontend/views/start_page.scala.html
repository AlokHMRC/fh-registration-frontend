                    <p>Make sure you have all the information you’ll need before you begin to apply online. In addition to the relevant UTR and your Government Gateway details, you may need the following information:</p>

                      <li>your VAT number and company registration number (if you have one)</li>

                    <h3>Businesses already trading as alcohol wholesalers prior to 1 April 2016</h3>
                    <p>You’ll receive an acknowledgement with a reference number for your application. This is not your AWRS Unique Registration Number (URN). You can continue to trade until you’ve received HMRC’s decision.</p>

                    <h3>Businesses starting to trade as alcohol wholesalers from 1 April 2016</h3>
                    <p>You must apply giving notice of at least 45 calendar days. This will allow HMRC to process your application and undertake the fit and proper test (details of which can be found in Part 6.10 of Excise Notice 2002). You’ll receive an acknowledgement with a reference number of your application.</p>

                    <div style="background-color: #DEE0E2; padding: 15px;">
                      <p>You can’t trade in alcohol wholesaling until you receive approval.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>For all applicants we may need to contact you in writing, by telephone, or you may receive a pre-approval visit from us to assist in the processing of your application.</p>
                    <p>There’s no need to phone HMRC to check the progress of your application. You can check online.</p>
                    <p>Once a decision has been made you’ll receive an email telling you to check online. If approved you’ll see your URN which you should make a note of. A URN is made up of 4 letters and 11 numbers, for example, XXAW00000123456.</p>
                    <p>From 1 April 2017 registered wholesalers will need to include the URN on wholesale sales invoices.</p>


                    <h2 id="exclusions-to-the-scheme2">Making changes</h2>

                    <p>You’ll need to use the same Government Gateway username and password that you used to make your initial application. You can then view the status of your request or make amendments.</p>

                    <h3>If your application is being processed</h3>

                    <p>You can make any necessary changes or correct errors in the information you supplied. You should do this as soon as possible, following the instructions for ‘making changes’.</p>

                    <div style="background-color: #DEE0E2; padding: 15px;">
                      <p><a href="#">Sign into the service to make changes.</a></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>If you’ve been approved by HMRC and received your AWRS URN</h3>

                    <p>You’ll need to tell HMRC about any changes to your details as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>HMRC must be notified of some changes no later than 14 days from the date of change, including changes to:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>partners</li>
                      <li>directors</li>
                      <li>phone numbers</li>
                      <li>email address</li>
                      <li>trading name</li>
                      <li>VAT number</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Tell HMRC about any change of address for your principal place of business or to any of your trading premises before you use the new premises.</p>
                    <p>Excise Notice 2002 paragraph 10.4 has a full list of changes and the circumstances where you need to immediately inform HMRC.</p>
                    <div style="background-color: #DEE0E2; padding: 15px;">
                      <p><a href="#">Sign into the service to make changes.</a></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Cancelling or withdrawing your approval</h3>

                    <p>If your AWRS application has been approved by HMRC but you decide to cancel it, you must let us know at least 30 days before the date you intend to stop trading in alcohol.</p>
                    <p>You should make arrangements to dispose of any wholesale alcohol stock before this date.</p>
                    <p>If your application hasn’t been approved you can withdraw an application where you’ve, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>applied in error</li>
                      <li>signed up as the wrong business type</li>
                      <li>decided not to trade</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div style="background-color: #DEE0E2; padding: 15px;">
